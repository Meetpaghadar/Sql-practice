# SQL-Practice 🧠📊

This repository contains my SQL practice problems and solutions, organized in a **one-file-per-question** format 📄.  
Each file includes the **problem description** followed by the **solution**, making it easy to review concepts efficiently.

## Background 🎯
I have completed the **LeetCode SQL 50**, which helped me build a strong foundation in SQL fundamentals and common problem-solving patterns.

As I progressed, I realized the importance of **documenting my work** ✍️—both to track progress and to create a structured resource for **revision and long-term learning**. While I’m starting this documentation a bit later in my journey, I am now consistently building and maintaining this archive.

## What This Repository Shows 🚀
- Practical SQL problem-solving skills  
- Consistent practice and revision habits  

This repository will continue to grow as I solve more problems and deepen my understanding of SQL 📈.
